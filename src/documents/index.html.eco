  <h4>Checkbox</h4>

  <p>
  Itâ€™s 2013. Everyday we trust the Internet to process billions of dollars, keep our social security numbers safe, as well as our medical information. Yet still, to cast a vote we need to drive to a polling station, wait in line, and fill in little bubbles with a pencil. We built CheckBox to change that. CheckBox combines new open source technology with a unique ID delivered by mail so that voting districts can easily create a secure ballot for voters to vote from home.

  Newspora is a crowdfunding news platform. On our platform journalists can raise funds from the 'crowd' to investigate topics/issues, which are not covered or not fully-covered by news organizations. These will be issues that people care about, since they are funded by people. Once the idea is funded, the journalist investigates the story, and the article is written, we will publish it on our platform and in one of the traditional media to get more attention to the issue. Our partnership with traditional media will give us their distribution channel and will provide them our content.
